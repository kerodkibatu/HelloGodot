# HelloGodot
This is a simple project I made to learn how to use Godot Engine following the tutorial by `Brackeys` on YouTube. The tutorial can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0).

It's a simple 2D platformer game where you play as a knight who has to collect coins and avoid enemies.

## Controls
- Movement: WASD
- Jump: Space
